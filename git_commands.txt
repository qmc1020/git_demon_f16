we are learning git commands today
We learned about
"git branch" it is used to make copies of our code that we can edit distinctly from other parts of the project
example usage:
git branch <my_new_branch>    # create branch
git checkout <my_new_branch>   #change  to branch
git branch push -u origin <my_new_branch>     #push new branch to server

Another 
git status      #tell us what has charges
git add filename     #stages file for commit
    commit -a        #commit all staged files
cp filename filename2
git log     #show all the commits
